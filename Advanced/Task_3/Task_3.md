### Database Schema
```
Users (id, username, email, password, role, profile data)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Posts (id, title, content, status, author_id, category_id)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Comments (id, content, status, author_id, post_id, parent_id)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PostTags (post_id, tag_id) [Many-to-Many]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Categories (id, name, slug, description, color)
