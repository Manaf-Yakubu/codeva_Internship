Hey there! Welcome to my comprehensive full-stack development environment setup guide. As someone who's been through the struggle of setting up development environments from scratch, I've created this repository to make your life easier. This contains everything you need to get up and running with modern web development tools - no more hunting around for installation guides or dealing with configuration headaches!

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before we dive in, make sure you have administrative privileges on your Windows machine. Trust me, you'll need them for some of the installations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

I've made this as simple as possible for you. Here's how to get started:

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yakubu-Abdul-Manaf/codeva_Internship.git
   cd Task_1
   ```

2. **Run my automated setup script**
   ```bash
   # For Windows PowerShell (run as Administrator)
   .\setup\setup-windows.ps1
   
   # Or if you prefer doing things manually, follow the guides below
   ```

## 📦 What I've Included For You

I've spent countless hours putting together everything you need:

- **Node.js & npm/yarn** - The heart of modern JavaScript development
- **Git** - Because version control is non-negotiable (trust me on this one)
- **VS Code** - My favorite code editor, configured with all the extensions you'll actually use
- **Database Options** - Complete setup guides for MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL
- **Terminal Mastery** - PowerShell and Git Bash configurations that actually work
- **Project Templates** - Ready-to-use templates so you can start coding immediately
